        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            My name is William Emmanuel Rodriguez. I am focused on building a strong foundation in Linux
            systems, IT fundamentals, and practical problem-solving through hands-on learning and
            documentation.

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
            My background includes experience in environments that emphasize discipline, structure,
            and accountability. These experiences have shaped how I approach technical learning,
            particularly when working with systems that require attention to detail and methodical
            troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently developing my technical skill set with an emphasis on understanding how
            systems work beneath the surface, rather than relying solely on graphical tools or
            abstracted workflows.
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>
            I approach technical work by prioritizing fundamentals, clarity, and repeatability. This
            includes working directly with the command line, documenting steps and observations, and
            intentionally practicing concepts in controlled environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to build habits that support long-term growth, such as careful documentation,
            version control, and a willingness to slow down in order to understand systems correctly.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Site Is</h2>

        <p>
            This website serves as a professional reference point for my learning and technical
            projects. It documents progress, highlights selected work, and provides context for how
            I approach problem-solving and system-level concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The content reflects an ongoing learning process and is intentionally focused on
            fundamentals rather than production-level claims.
